# Sales Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project collects and analyses sales data from various regions, markets, and stores. The goal is to provide insights into revenue, units sold, and transaction categories over different periods. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue trends and sales performance across regions and calculating key metrics such as average revenue by region.

## Data Collected
The dataset includes the following key columns:

1. Region: The geographical area where the store operates.
2. Market: The specific market segment or category within a region.
3. Store: The individual store from which the sales data is collected.
4. Trade Date: The date on which a particular sale or transaction was made.
5. Fiscal Period: The fiscal quarter or period to which the trade date belongs.
6. Model: The product model being sold.
7. Line of Business (LOB): The business line or category under which the sale falls.
8. Day: The day of the week for the transaction.
9. Category: The broader category of the item (e.g., electronics, apparel).
10. Revenue: The total monetary value generated from the sale.
11. Units Sold: The number of units sold for a given transaction.
12. Transaction Category: A classification of the transaction (e.g., online, in-store).

## Project Objectives
This project was designed to address the following analysis goals:

- Revenue by Region: Determine the total revenue generated in each region.
- Region by Units Sold: Analyze the number of units sold across different regions to identify the highest-selling locations.
- Average Revenue by Region: Calculate the average revenue per sale in each region to assess performance.

## Key Metrics

- Revenue: Sum of the revenue column, grouped by region.
- Units Sold: Sum of units sold, grouped by region.
- Average Revenue: Calculated as Total Revenue / Total Units Sold for each region to measure the revenue efficiency.

## How to Use the Data

- Revenue by Region: Group the data by region and sum the revenue column. This provides an overview of how much revenue each region is generating.

- Units Sold by Region: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify which regions are moving the most products.

- Average Revenue by Region: To get the average revenue per transaction or unit sold in a region, use the formula:

## Formula Used
```
Average Revenue = Total Revenue / Units Sold
```
## Tools and Methods Used
- Data Analysis: The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, utilizing Pivot Tables to organize, summarize, and filter the data for easier interpretation.

- Data Visualization: Bar Charts were created in Excel to visually represent the key insights.

## Inference:

## Revenue by Region (Bar Chart)
- The North East region has the highest revenue, generating over 12 billion in sales.
- South West and South-South regions also perform strongly, with sales close to 10 billion and 8 billion, respectively.
- The South East and North West regions have moderate sales, generating between 6 to 7 billion.
- The North Central region shows the lowest revenue performance, below 4 billion.

## Revenue by Region (Line Chart)
- The line chart reinforces the same trend, showing a declining revenue trajectory across regions from North East (highest) to North Central (lowest).
- The steepest decline is observed from North East to South West, followed by gradual decreases across the remaining regions.

## Key Insights:
1. The North East is the top-performing region in terms of revenue.
2. There is a significant drop in revenue moving from the North East to South West, and the decline continues steadily across other regions.
3. The North Central region lags significantly in revenue generation, potentially indicating an area for sales strategy improvement.
