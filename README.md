# Sales Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project collects and analyses sales data from various regions, markets, and stores. The goal is to provide insights into revenue, units sold, and transaction categories over different periods. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue trends and sales performance across regions and calculating key metrics such as average revenue by region.

## Data Collected
The dataset includes the following key columns:

1. Region: The geographical area where the store operates.
2. Market: The specific market segment or category within a region.
3. Store: The individual store from which the sales data is collected.
4. Trade Date: The date on which a particular sale or transaction was made.
5. Fiscal Period: The fiscal quarter or period to which the trade date belongs.
6. Model: The product model being sold.
7. Line of Business (LOB): The business line or category under which the sale falls.
8. Day: The day of the week for the transaction.
9. Category: The broader category of the item (e.g., electronics, apparel).
10. Revenue: The total monetary value generated from the sale.
11. Units Sold: The number of units sold for a given transaction.
12. Transaction Category: A classification of the transaction (e.g., online, in-store).

## Project Objectives
This project was designed to address the following analysis goals:

- Revenue by Region: Determine the total revenue generated in each region.
- Region by Units Sold: Analyze the number of units sold across different regions to identify the highest-selling locations.
- Average Revenue by Region: Calculate the average revenue per sale in each region to assess performance.

## Key Metrics

- Revenue: Sum of the revenue column, grouped by region.
- Units Sold: Sum of units sold, grouped by region.
- Average Revenue: Calculated as Total Revenue / Total Units Sold for each region to measure the revenue efficiency.

## How to Use the Data

- Revenue by Region: Group the data by region and sum the revenue column. This provides an overview of how much revenue each region is generating.

- Units Sold by Region: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify which regions are moving the most products.

- Average Revenue by Region: To get the average revenue per transaction or unit sold in a region, use the formula:

## Formula Used
```
Average Revenue = Total Revenue / Units Sold
```
## Tools and Methods Used
- Data Analysis: The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, utilizing Pivot Tables to organize, summarize, and filter the data for easier interpretation.

- Data Visualization: Bar Charts were created in Excel to visually represent the key insights.

## Inference:

1. *Overall Revenue Trends*:
   - There is a noticeable decline in total revenue across most regions from 2014 to 2015. This suggests potential challenges in sales performance or market conditions affecting revenue generation.

2. *Regional Performance*:
   - *North East*: The North East region had the highest revenue in 2014 but shows a significant drop in 2015. This decline may indicate market saturation or increased competition.
   - *South West*: This region also shows a decrease in revenue, although it remains one of the higher-performing areas.
   - *South South*: The revenue for this region appears to have decreased slightly, indicating a potential area of concern.
   - *South East*: Similar to the South South, this region also shows a decline in revenue, which could suggest challenges in maintaining sales.
   - *North West and North Central*: Both regions show lower revenue figures, with North Central consistently trailing behind other regions.

3. *Revenue Distribution*:
   - The bar charts illustrate a clear drop in revenue for 2015 compared to 2014, indicating that while the North East led in 2014, the gap between regions has narrowed, suggesting that overall market conditions may be affecting all regions similarly.

4. *Strategic Implications*:
   - The decline in revenue across regions indicates a need for a strategic reassessment. The company may need to investigate the causes of this decline, such as changes in consumer behavior, economic factors, or competitive pressures.
   - Focused marketing efforts and customer engagement strategies may be necessary to revitalize sales in declining regions, particularly in the North East and South West.

### Conclusion
The revenue data from 2014 to 2015 shows a concerning trend of declining revenue across most regions. This highlights the need for the company to analyze market conditions and implement strategies to boost performance and regain lost revenue. Addressing the challenges faced by the North East and South West regions, in particular, will be crucial for future growth.

## Inference:

1. *Overall Sales Growth*: There is a noticeable increase in total units sold from 2014 to 2015. The North East region, while still leading, shows a decrease in the number of units sold compared to the previous year, indicating a potential saturation in that market.

2. *Regional Performance Changes*:
   - *North East*: In 2014, the North East accounted for 27% of total sales, but this dropped to 26% in 2015. This suggests a slight decline in its dominance.
   - *South West*: The South West region has improved its performance, increasing its share from 21% to 22%. This indicates a positive trend and potential for further growth.
   - *North Central and North West*: Both regions continue to show low sales figures, indicating a need for targeted strategies to boost performance in these areas.

3. *Market Dynamics*: The South East and South South regions maintained a steady performance, with the South East holding at 16% and the South South slightly increasing its share. This stability may suggest a consistent demand in these regions.

4. *Sales Distribution*: The pie chart reflects a more balanced distribution of sales across regions in 2015 compared to 2014. The North East's slight decline in percentage share indicates that other regions are gaining traction, which could be a sign of shifting consumer preferences or effective marketing strategies in those areas.

5. *Strategic Implications*: The data suggests that while the North East remains a key market, the company should consider investing more resources into the South West and potentially explore opportunities in the North Central and North West regions to enhance overall sales performance.

### Conclusion
The sales data from 2015 indicates a shift in market dynamics, with some regions improving their performance while the North East shows signs of stagnation. A strategic focus on underperforming areas, along with continued support for growing regions, could lead to more balanced and sustainable growth in the future.

   - *South East and South South*: Both regions appear to have similar average revenues, with no significant changes from 2014 to 2015.
   - *South West*: This region also shows a stable average revenue, indicating consistent performance.

3. *Revenue Distribution*:
   - The bar charts indicate that while North Central leads, the gap between regions is not vast, suggesting a more balanced revenue distribution across regions in 2015 compared to 2014.

4. *Strategic Implications*:
   - The stability in revenue across regions suggests that while some areas are performing well, there may be opportunities for growth in regions like the South East and South South. Targeted marketing strategies could help enhance their performance.
   - The North Central region's strong performance should be leveraged as a model for other regions, potentially sharing successful strategies or practices.

### Conclusion
The average revenue data from 2014 to 2015 indicates overall growth, with stable performances across most regions. The company should focus on maintaining this momentum while exploring opportunities for improvement in regions that are currently underperforming.
